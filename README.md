I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich (Distributional Linguistics Lab). My general research interests comprise morphology and diachrony, and the pressures that shape them. More concretely, I have been exploring the relevance of paradigmatic structure in inflectional morphology, with special attention to complex and extra-morphologically unmotivated phenomena like morphomes and inflection classes. I do this by drawing on quantitative and qualitative data from languages all over the world.
